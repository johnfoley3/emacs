** Stack Overflow Log
[[http://superuser.com/questions/402747/emacs-eshell-over-ssh-not-obeying-key-commands-or-elisp][SSH and Eshell are not behaving]]
** Themes
[[https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-good-Emacs-color-themes-to-use][Quora forum for suggested themes]]
I have tried out:
default theme 
*** TODO find the name of the default theme
*** Blackboard
Pretty vibrant dark theme. didn't like it a whole lot yet.
*** Zenburn
low contrast, dark theme. I like it fine, but the light default theme is pretty awesome.
